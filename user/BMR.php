		<!-- basal metabolic rate (BMR)  -->

		<p> <b>Note: </b> Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy (measured in calories) that your body requires to maintain basic physiological functions while at rest. These functions include breathing, circulation, cell production, and other processes that keep your body alive. In other words, BMR represents the energy your body needs to function even if you were just lying in bed all day without any physical activity. <i> Calculating BMR is often done using various formulas, with one of the most commonly used being the <strong>Harris-Benedict Equation</strong>. The basic version of this equation is:

				BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years)
